# haskell-workshop
Haskell Workshop for use at the ESD Module in Informatics course at Fontys Venlo.

## Preparation
In order to be actively involved in our workshop we ask you to install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc) and preferably a [Haskell-aware text editor](https://wiki.haskell.org/Editors) in advance.

The following sections describe the most common steps to install ghc on different platforms. If you need more assistance you can go to [the official Haskell site](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or simply ask us directly.

### Linux
In all major distributions ghc is included and can be installed using the native package manager.
For Debian based systems like Ubuntu or Mint this would be:
```
sudo apt-get install ghc
```
### Windows
Download and install the [core package](https://haskell.org/platform/download/8.4.3/HaskellPlatform-8.4.3-core-x86_64-setup.exe). Afterwards you should be able to invoke ghc from command prompt:
```
C:\>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.4.3

```
### MacOS
Download and install the [core package](https://haskell.org/platform/download/8.6.3/Haskell%20Platform%208.6.3%20Core%2064bit-signed.pkg).
