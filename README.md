# haskell-workshop
Haskell Workshop for use at the ESD Module in Informatics course at Fontys Venlo.

## Preparation
In order to be actively involved in our workshop we ask you to install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc) in advance.
The following sections describe the most common installation steps on different platforms. If you need more information you can go to  

## Linux
In all major distributions ghc is included and can be installed using the native package manager.
For Debian based systems like Ubuntu or Mint this would be:
```
sudo apt-get install ghc
```
## Windows
Download and install the [core package](https://haskell.org/platform/download/8.4.3/HaskellPlatform-8.4.3-core-x86_64-setup.exe) from the [official Haskell website](https://www.haskell.org/). Afterwards you should be able to invoke ghc from command prompt:
```
C:\>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.4.3

```
